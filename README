Also we would like you to create a listview of all the orders made to the pizzeria with the possibility to filter the orders using the name or the email of the customer.
Make sure all Requests hit the Backend and everything gets saved in the database.

To Access the example Data given in the Backend theres a detailed API-Documentation under http://localhost:8000/swagger/ .
Also in the backend/README is a detailed section to setup the Backend including the Sampledata.
